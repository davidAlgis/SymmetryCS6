# Radial Symmetry Tool

This Photoshop CS6 script lets you draw in a single wedge of the canvas and automatically replicate your strokes across **8 radial sectors**. It has been made to replicate the behavior of [procreate](https://help.procreate.com/procreate/handbook/guides/guides-symmetry). 

# How to run it

1. Open your document in Photoshop CS6.  
2. Go to **File → Scripts → Browse…** and select the `symmetry.jsx` file.  
3. Draw only inside the highlighted wedge on the `PAINT_HERE` layer, then run the script again to update the symmetry.

### (Optional) Faster with Actions
- Press **Alt+F9** to open the **Actions panel**.  
- Create a new Action, start recording, then go to **File → Scripts → Browse…** and run the script once.  
- Stop recording and assign a Function Key (e.g. **F2**).  
- From now on, pressing your shortcut runs the script instantly.
